    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This portfolio showcases my journey as a B.Tech student with a strong interest in software development and problem-solving.
         It highlights my technical skills, academic projects, hands-on experience with data structures, databases, and full-stack development,
          along with my passion for building scalable and efficient solutions. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my readiness for real-world
           challenges and internship opportunities in top product-based companies.</p>
